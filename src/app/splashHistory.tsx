              Positioning Aggies as Leaders in the Wine&nbsp;Industry
            </h2>
            <p>
              At UC Davis, students can pursue a Bachelor of Science, Master of
              Science, or a minor in Viticulture and Enology. These programs
              combine a strong scientific foundation in grape growing and
              winemaking with hands-on, experiential learning in vineyards and
              wineries. Ph.D. students and postdoctoral scholars also have
              opportunities to conduct research alongside our world-class
              multidisciplinary V&E faculty.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The career opportunities for V&E graduates are limitless, with
              many going on to be winemakers, vineyard managers, professors,
              consultants, researchers, industry leaders, and more. The V&E
              Departmentâ€™s cutting-edge facilities, research-driven curriculum,
              and deep industry ties shape students into thinkers,
              problem-solvers, and leaders whose careers will help transform the
              wine industry locally and globally.
