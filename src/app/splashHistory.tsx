              At UC Davis, students can earn a Master of Science degree,
              Bachelor of Science degree, or a minor in viticulture and enology.
              These degrees equip students with the scientific foundation of
              winemaking, combined with hands-on experiential learning in the
              vineyard and winery. PhD and postdoctoral scholars can further
              perform research in the laboratories of our multidisciplinary V&E
              faculty.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-lg">
              The career opportunities for V&E graduates are limitless, with
              many going on to be winemakers, vineyard managers, professors,
              consultants, researchers, industry leaders, and more. The V&E
              Departmentâ€™s cutting-edge facilities, research-driven curriculum,
              and deep industry ties shape students into thinkers,
              problem-solvers, and leaders whose careers will help transform the
              wine industry locally and globally.
